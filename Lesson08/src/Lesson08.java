/*

advanced data structures
========================

arrays and linked lists are not ideal for *searching*

binary tree
-----------
- like linked list, contains value and reference to other nodes: 0,1 or 2 references to child nodes
- terms:  root, child, parent, ancestor, descendant, leaf, height ( = depth | # levels), balanced | unbalanced

binary search tree
------------------
- binary tree with the property that every child to left is < its parent, and every child to the right is > parent.value
    - values must therefore be comparable
- each node has at most 2 children
- no duplicates (variants w/dupes do exist)
- appropriate when
    - dynamically sized data
    - frequent searches
    - data changes frequently

sets
----
collection of *unique* values
