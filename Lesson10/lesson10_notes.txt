Algorithms
==========


memoization 
  - using more memory to reduce number of computations

greedy algorithms
  - at each step, tries to make a locally optimal choice
  - 'greedy' because they have no knowledge of the big picture, they only choose what's best for them, in the moment!
  - usually not the *best* solution
    - they are short-sighted
    - also non-recoverable
    but, 
      - also frequently simple and fast



HOMEWORK
========

- get all the CoinCounter tests passing
- optional: look at the Lesson 09 code
